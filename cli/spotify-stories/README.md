# Spotify Stories

This repository is an experiment for a CLI app written in Rust that integrates a database using using Diesel.

The app uses the Clap library for command parsing, which allows users to easily interact with the app through the command line. The ORM aspect of the app is handled by Diesel, which provides a simple way to interact with databases in a type-safe and efficient manner.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.55.0 or later
- Diesel CLI

## Installation

To install the app, clone this repository to your local machine and run the following command:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```
